# Easy-Captcha-Bot

**Project Created January 2019 via PYTHON**

--> In high school, I was highly involved in buying and reselling popular sneakers, like Yeezys, Jordans, etc.

--> These releases often would go live and sell out very quickly.

--> One thing that would slow me and other buyers down a lot is the possibilty of getting stuck on a very difficult captcha, requiring you to click multiple images, and sometimes with multiple rounds of questions. 

--> I learned from others in the sneaker community and from my own research that a Google account's reCaptcha score level will determine the difficulty of the captcha sent to the user. 

--> If you log into a Google account with a high reCaptcha score, your chances of getting a one-click captcha, where you simply click the box and it submits without asking any questions, is high. 

--> 2 main ways to get a high reCaptcha score is to 1) have an older Google account, and 2) have a Google account that is actively used

--> My Easy Captcha Bot Python Project automates activity on your Google account in order to get easy captchas via Google.
